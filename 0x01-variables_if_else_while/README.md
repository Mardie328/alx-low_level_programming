## 0x01-variables_if_else_while

**This project is about variables, loops and conditional statements in C.**


**[0-positive_or_negative.c](https://github.com/Mardie328/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c)** - Assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and prints whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

**[1-last_digit.c](https://github.com/Mardie328/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c)** - Assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

**[2-print_alphabet.c](https://github.com/Mardie328/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c)** - A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

**[3-print_alphabets.c](https://github.com/Mardie328/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c)** - A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

**[4-print_alphabt.c](https://github.com/Mardie328/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c)** - A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

**[5-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/Mardie328/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c)** - A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

**[6-print_numberz.c](https://github.com/Mardie328/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c)** - A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

**[7-print_tebahpla.c](https://github.com/Mardie328/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c)** - A program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.

**[8-print_base16.c](https://github.com/Mardie328/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c)** - A program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.

**[9-print_comb.c](https://github.com/Mardie328/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c)** - A program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

**[100-print_comb3.c](https://github.com/Mardie328/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/100-print_comb3.c)** - A program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

**[101-print_comb4.c](https://github.com/Mardie328/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/101-print_comb4.c)** - A program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.

**[102-print_comb5.c](https://github.com/Mardie328/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/102-print_comb5.c)** - A program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
