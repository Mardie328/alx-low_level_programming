## 0x14. C - Bit manipulation

**This project is about bit manipulation in C programmig language.**

**[main.h](https://github.com/Mardie328/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x14-bit_manipulation/main.h)** - header file

**[0-binary_to_uint.c](https://github.com/Mardie328/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x14-bit_manipulation/0-binary_to_uint.c)** - a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

**[1-print_binary.c](https://github.com/Mardie328/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x14-bit_manipulation/1-print_binary.c)** - a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

**[2-get_bit.c](https://github.com/Mardie328/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x14-bit_manipulation/2-get_bit.c)** -  a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

**[3-set_bit.c](https://github.com/Mardie328/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x14-bit_manipulation/3-set_bit.c)** -  a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

**[4-clear_bit.c](https://github.com/Mardie328/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x14-bit_manipulation/4-clear_bit.c)** - a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

**[5-flip_bits.c](https://github.com/Mardie328/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x14-bit_manipulation/5-flip_bits.c)** - a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

**[100-get_endianness.c](https://github.com/Mardie328/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x14-bit_manipulation/100-get_endianness.c)** - a function that checks the endianness.
